### Chocolate-Covered Caramel Matzoh

http://www.davidlebovitz.com/2008/01/chocolatecovere/

Noah made this with a bit of sea salt instead of almonds.  Make sure to add the chocolate chips right out of of the oven so they melt properly.

### Lemon Blueberry Muffins

http://www.alaskafromscratch.com/2014/01/22/lemon-blueberry-muffins/

Noah recommends using buttermilk instead of milk, and cutting the recipe for the cinnamon topping in half, it makes much more than you need.  Err on the side of underbaking.

### Easy Brisket

Cook this the night before serving.

1. Season brisket fat side up in a roasting pan.
2. Add about 3/4 qt. of beef stock and 1/2 bottle of high-quality BBQ sauce.
3. Cover tightly and cook at 325 degrees for about 5 hours until tender.
4. Chill overnight.
5. Remove from the fridge and defat the sauce.
6. Slice and rewarm in the oven to serve.

### Rather Sweet Noodle Kugel

Noah's favorite. Also makes a great breakfast the next day. To make this kosher for Passover, omit Corn Flakes and use potato noodles instead of egg noodles.

**Ingredients**

* 1 8 oz. package of cream cheese
* 1.5 cups milk
* 0.5 cups granulated sugar
* 1 stick salted butter
* 4 eggs
* 0.5 lbs wide Manischewitz egg noodles
* Corn Flakes

**Instructions**

1. Cook egg noodles according to package instructions.
2. Beat together remaining ingredients besides cornflakes.
3. Add noodles to beaten mixture and stir.
4. Put entire mixture in a buttered 13"x9" casserole dish.
5. Top liberally with Corn Flakes.
6. Bake for 1.25 hours at 325 degrees.

### Brown Butter Sea Salt Chocolate Chip Cookies

Keep the dough balls very round.  Underbake these and let them finish outside the oven.  In Noah's experience they're great fresh but don't keep that well. He's probably doing something wrong.

### Very Rich Brownies

http://smittenkitchen.com/blog/2012/08/my-favorite-brownies/

These are already very decadent, bordering on fudge.  You can make them even moreso by drizzling caramel sauce over the top and swirling with a knife before baking (but make sure the sauce stays on the top, don't swirl it in deep or else these are impossible to extract from the pan)

### Coconut Banana Bread

Noah recommends adding extra coconut (to all things, but especially this).

### Monkey Bread Muffins

http://www.cookingclassy.com/2012/02/monkey-bread-muffins-quite-possibly-the-best-thing-ive-ever-eaten/

Ridiculous and delicious.

### Apple Muffins

http://www.loveandlemons.com/2013/03/13/apple-muffins/

Hearty, not overly sweet.  Use more apple than the recipe calls for (at least 1.5 apples, maybe 2).

### Charoset

**Ingredients**

* 3 peeled apples, coarsely chopped
* 1/3 cup finely chopped walnuts
* 2 tbsp sugar
* 0.5 tsp cinnamon or more to taste
* Grated rind of 1 lemon
* 4 tbsp sweet red wine (kosher Manischewitz wine or similar)

Mix all ingredients together and cover and chill in the fridge for at least a day. Great with matzoh or other crackers. Keeps for at least a week.

### Chocolate Chip Buttered Popcorn Cookies

http://joythebaker.com/2013/04/buttered-popcorn-chocolate-chip-cookies/

Adapted from the Smitten Kitchen Cookbook. My (Kat's) mods were to use 1/3 cup popcorn, not 1/4; to use salted butter on the popcorn; and, as suggested, to sprinkle sea salt on them, but I used Maldon, the flaky kind. 

### Sweet Chili Sauce

http://picturetherecipe.com/index.php/recipes/sweet-and-spicy-chili-sauce-thai-style/

A really easy sweet, chili sauce recipe.  Made many times by Alan and easy to mix in some rhubarb for more tangy flavor.

### Earl grey chocolate chip cookies 

http://www.designlovefest.com/2015/03/earl-grey-chocolate-chip-cookies/

I (Emily Chow) recommend steeping the 1 tsp of tea in more milk than you need just so you don't end up with too-dry dough. Also, flatten the dough balls a bit before putting them in the oven. They don't end up as flat as the photos show.

### Dark chocolate, pistachio and smoked sea salt cookies

http://joythebaker.com/2012/08/dark-chocolate-pistachio-smoked-sea-salt-cookies/

The perfect amount of salty and sweet. — Emily Chow

### Sunset's chocolate peanut butter thumbprint cookies 

http://www.myrecipes.com/recipe/chocolate-peanut-butter-thumbprint-cookies

Super popular at ONA Atlanta 2013. — Emily Chow

### Blueberry lemon squares

http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/2011/03/cranberry-lemon-squares/

I'm sure they're just as good with cranberries, as the original recipe calls for, but I love substituting the cranberries for blueberries because I find cranberries too tart in a baked good. — Emily Chow
